                    student can be challenging. While there are many
                    opportunities, it is hard to acquire a project for the first
                    time. At the university, a company helps students do
                    freelance jobs. They provide precise and structured projects
                    and guide the students. This company is named MKB DataLab.
                    Students are paid on a project basis, and a project is about
                    80 hours. Clients often ask students to work directly for
                    them after the first project. Since there are no{" "}

                    />{" "}
                    , some students decided to do extra or new work directly
                    with the client. The MKB DataLab sent a mail after this came
                    to their ear. It stated there was no contractual restriction
                    since not working directly for another company was logically

                    . The ease of communicating that something is just logical
                    from an ethical perspective, triggers me to dig deeper. In
                    an ethical sense, what are freelance students obliged in
                    relationship with clients to the MKB DataLab?

                    While many jobs provide steady pay and security, freelancing
                    has some risks. Contracts are often for a limited time,
                    workers are not insured, and risk of late or no payment.
                    But, in return, there is more freedom to do the work you
                    like. Work more for clients you enjoy working for. If the
                    client likes your work, chances are high you get a new job.
                    Suppose you choose this freedom and the risks that come with
                    it. You generated the new project, and you do not want to
                    share the profits. Is there something wrong with this?

                    On the other hand, the MKB DataLab's primary income is from
                    students doing their projects. They provide the first
                    contact and project. Therefore, they feel like it is their
                    client, and you are not allowed to work with that client on
                    your own. However, they could also give students a contract
                    and a job. Then students would still do the projects while
                    the MKB DataLab employs them. Moreover, MKB DataLab markets
                    itself as promoting entrepreneurship by students. When
                    students create, following their excellent work, new jobs,
                    they are then not allowed to take the opportunity to work
                    with a client directly.

                    {" "}
                    There are contractual clauses to limit using relationships
                    gained from another client. This is called a relationship
                    clause. This relationship clause often does not hold in the
                    court. However, an important aspect is the balance of market
                    power. How much is the organization negatively influenced by
                    choice of a freelancer to work directly for these clients?
                    The MKB Datalab its main income results from finding clients
                    and projects and using freelancers for those projects.
                    Therefore, the influence on the MKB DataLab is significant.
                    They invest highly in acquisition and then miss out on the
                    return of the investment.

                    could be evaluated. For instance,{" "}

                    , if you are open and honest about doing extra work. There
                    is nothing wrong with this part. Next, let's look at{" "}

                      defnintion='Impartial and just treatment or behaviour without favouritism or discrimination.'
                    />
                    , and there are different ways to view fairness. On one
                    side, it is not fair to always want to gain on freelancers
                    after only initiating the first contact. On the other hand,
                    without the MKB DataLab, there was no project to do at all.
                    Then there is{" "}
                    <Definition
                      text='loyalty'
                      defnintion='giving or showing firm and constant support or allegiance to a person or institution.'
                    />
                    . Loyalty brings us to an interesting dilemma. How loyal are
                    you as a freelancer? By definition, you are less loyal than
                    an employee. But should you behave that way? In addition,
                    there is another crucial stakeholder in this equation: the
                    company that wants to work with the students directly. They
                    are not loyal to the MKB DataLab. Again there are several
                    ways to look at this.

                      The MKB DataLab fills a remarkable gap. They are creating
                      projects so that students can quickly work as a
                      freelancer. However, the amount of loyalty they expect
                      from freelancers might be overrated. In addition, the
                      clients want to work with freelancers directly. Therefore,
                      the added value from the MKB

                    <br />

                      {" "}
                      DataLab seems to decline after the first contact. The
                      freelancers get an opportunity to gain work experience. In
                      addition, the guidance of the MKB DataLab might give them
                      the confidence to do their first projects. However, the
                      MKB DataLab cannot exist when students are not sharing
                      profits from follow up jobs. Therefore, it is fair that
                      the students inform the MKB DataLab and share the profits.

                      It is clear that the statement, logical from an ethical
                      perspective, has some inherent problems. Ethics are not
                      logical. They are complex and provide for dilemmas. There
                      is no clear cut answer to this case. The question is more
                      individual: "What kind of freelancer do you want to be?".
                      Do you choose freedom over fairness and loyalty?
